**Focus**: DEFECTS ONLY - bugs, dead code, obsolete documentation, security vulnerabilities, performance regressions, architectural drift

**Success Criteria Met**:
- [x] Clean main branch with latest changes
- [x] SPRINT_BACKLOG empty (required for PLAY workflow)  
- [x] Functioning build system (94 modules, 100% success)
- [x] Test infrastructure verified (33 tests discoverable)
- [x] Separate PLAY working directory created and verified
- [x] Infrastructure assessment complete
- [x] Team coordination setup ready

## Next Steps - PLAY Workflow Protocol

1. **winny-writer**: Complete documentation rewrite in `/home/ert/code/fortcov-play`
2. **patrick-auditor**: Dead code detection (parallel audit) - file issues immediately
3. **vicky-tester**: Bug detection (parallel audit) - file issues immediately  
4. **chris-architect**: Final audit - consolidate findings and schedule in SPRINT_BACKLOG

**INFRASTRUCTURE HANDOFF COMPLETE** ✅  
**PLAY WORKFLOW READY TO PROCEED** ✅
