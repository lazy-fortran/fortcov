# Issue #430 Resolution Documentation

## Problem
Zero-config fortcov (running `fortcov` without arguments) failed with "Configuration validation failed" error instead of executing the zero-configuration workflow.

## Root Cause  
The `validate_input_sources` function in `input_source_validator.f90` required at least one input source (source paths, coverage files, import file, or diff files) and did not have an exception for zero-configuration mode.

## Solution
PR #440 added the zero-configuration mode exception to the input validation logic:

```fortran
! Must have at least one input source (including diff files)
! Exception: zero-configuration mode handles input discovery automatically
if (.not. has_source_paths .and. &
    .not. has_coverage_files .and. &
    .not. has_import_file .and. &
    .not. has_diff_files .and. &
    .not. config%zero_configuration_mode) then
    is_valid = .false.
    error_message = "No input sources specified. Provide source paths, coverage files, import file, or diff files"
    return
end if
```

## Verification
- ✅ `fortcov` (no arguments) enters zero-config workflow successfully
- ✅ No "Configuration validation failed" error
- ✅ Provides helpful guidance when no coverage files found
- ✅ Manual specification still works: `fortcov file.gcov --source=src`

## Status: RESOLVED
Issue #430 was resolved by the architectural fix in PR #440. Zero-config mode now works as designed per DESIGN.md Sprint 1 objectives.

Note: Auto-discovery of files in build/gcov/ directory has a separate issue that should be addressed in a future sprint.
