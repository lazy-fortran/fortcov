    ! Note: All implementation has been moved to specialized modules:
    ! - coverage_data_model.f90: Type definitions and basic initialization
    ! - coverage_operations.f90: Coverage calculations, merging, and operations
    !
    ! This architecture enables:
    ! - Better separation of concerns between data and operations
    ! - Improved testability of individual components
    ! - Easier maintenance and modification
    ! - Compliance with 400-line module size targets
    ! - Preserved backward compatibility
