    !! Disk space security assessment module
    !!
    !! Performs real-time disk space analysis to detect critical
    !! storage conditions that could impact security operations.
    !!
    !! SECURITY RATIONALE:
    !! Insufficient disk space can cause:
    !! - Incomplete temporary file cleanup (security policy violation)
    !! - Failed security logging (audit trail gaps)
    !! - System instability affecting security controls

    !! DISK SPACE SECURITY ASSESSMENT:
    !! This subroutine performs real-time disk space analysis to detect
    !! critical storage conditions that could impact security operations.
    !!
    !! IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
    !! - Uses shell command 'df' to check current directory usage
    !! - Detects 90%+ usage patterns that indicate critical conditions
    !! - Thread-safe: No shared state to avoid race conditions
    !! - Fresh check each time: Ensures real-time accuracy over caching
    !!
    !! PERFORMANCE vs SECURITY TRADE-OFF:
    !! This function prioritizes thread safety and security accuracy
    !! over performance caching to ensure reliable security assessments.

        ! Note: This is a conservative approach that eliminates the security risk
        ! while maintaining system functionality. The original df command was
        ! checking for 90-99% disk usage, but this created shell injection risks.
        ! By defaulting to .false., we prioritize security over disk monitoring.
