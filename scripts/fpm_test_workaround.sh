# FPM Test Workaround Script
# Issue #587: Fix test suite failures with missing test executable
#
# This script works around FPM 0.12.0-alpha bug where test directory structure
# is not created during test compilation, causing "executable not found" errors.
#
# Root cause: FPM compiles and links tests successfully but fails to ensure
# the test output directory exists before attempting to place executables there.
