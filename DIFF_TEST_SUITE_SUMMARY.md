## Implementation Guidance

### For Sergei's Phase 2 Implementation:

1. **Start with Core Algorithm** (`test_coverage_diff.f90`)
   - Implement `line_diff_t` operations first
   - Focus on delta calculations and newly covered/uncovered detection
   - Build up to file-level and project-level aggregations

2. **Add CLI Integration** (`test_cli_diff_integration.f90`)  
   - Implement diff command processing
   - Add file validation and security checks
   - Handle error scenarios gracefully

3. **Use Test Data Helpers** (`test_diff_data_generation.f90`)
   - Utilize provided test scenarios for validation
   - Generate realistic test data for development
   - Validate algorithm correctness with known scenarios

4. **Optimize Performance** (`test_diff_performance.f90`)
   - Ensure algorithms meet timing requirements
   - Optimize memory usage for large datasets
   - Validate scalability assumptions

5. **Handle Edge Cases** (`test_diff_edge_cases.f90`)
   - Implement robust error handling
   - Handle all identified edge cases
   - Ensure graceful degradation

## Success Criteria

**Phase 2 will be complete when:**
- All 112 tests pass (25+17+31+16+tests from data generation)
- Performance requirements are met
- CLI integration works correctly
- Edge cases are handled gracefully
- Code follows TDD principles (tests were written first)

## Next Steps

1. **Run Tests** - All tests currently fail (RED phase)
2. **Implement Algorithm** - Make tests pass one by one (GREEN phase)  
3. **Refactor** - Clean up implementation while keeping tests green (REFACTOR phase)
4. **Validate** - Ensure real-world scenarios work correctly

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage for all aspects of the diff functionality and will guide a robust, well-tested implementation.
