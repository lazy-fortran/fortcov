# Investigation Report: Issue #264 - Improve fortcov path detection

## Issue Summary
Issue #264 reported hardcoded fortcov path detection in `test/test_readme_workflow_issue_260.f90` with lines:
```fortran
fortcov_path = "fortcov"  ! Assumes it's in PATH
```

## Investigation Results

### File System Search
1. **Target file not found**: `test/test_readme_workflow_issue_260.f90` does not exist
2. **Comprehensive search**: No Fortran test files contain hardcoded `fortcov_path = "fortcov"` assignments
3. **Pattern verification**: No current test files assume fortcov is in PATH without proper discovery

### Current State Analysis
- Shell scripts in `test/` directory implement proper fortcov discovery using `find` commands
- Example from `test_issue_260_comprehensive.sh.FORK_BOMB_DISABLED`:
  ```bash
  FORTCOV_BIN=$(find /home/ert/code/fortcov/build -name fortcov -type f -executable | head -1)
  ```
- No Fortran test files execute fortcov without proper path validation

### Historical Context
Issue was reported from PR #261 review, suggesting the problematic file may have been:
1. Refactored to use proper path discovery
2. Removed during code cleanup
3. Renamed to a different pattern

## Conclusion
Issue #264 appears to be **obsolete**. The reported problematic code pattern does not exist in the current codebase:
- Target file `test/test_readme_workflow_issue_260.f90` not found
- No hardcoded fortcov PATH assumptions found in any test files
- Existing test infrastructure uses proper executable discovery patterns

**Recommendation**: Close issue as resolved/obsolete.
