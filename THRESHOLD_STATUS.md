# Threshold Enforcement Status

## Working Features ✅

### Regular .gcov file analysis
- `--threshold` option: Working correctly
  - Exit code 0 when coverage meets threshold
  - Exit code 2 (EXIT_THRESHOLD_NOT_MET) when coverage below threshold
  - Proper error messages displayed

- `--fail-under` option: Working correctly  
  - Exit code 0 when coverage meets fail-under
  - Exit code 2 (EXIT_THRESHOLD_NOT_MET) when coverage below fail-under
  - Proper error messages displayed

- Both options work together correctly
  - Either threshold violation triggers exit code 2
  - Both thresholds are checked independently

### Test Results
All tests pass with test_coverage.gcov (75% coverage):
- ✅ 50% threshold: PASS (exit 0)
- ✅ 80% threshold: FAIL (exit 2) 
- ✅ 70% fail-under: PASS (exit 0)
- ✅ 80% fail-under: FAIL (exit 2)
- ✅ Multiple thresholds work correctly

## Known Issues ⚠️

### JSON Import Path
The JSON import functionality (`--import`) has issues with file reading/parsing:
- File validation passes but JSON parsing fails
- Threshold checking code is implemented but unreachable due to parsing issue
- Root cause: The import_json_coverage_safe function appears to always return an error

### Implementation Details
- Threshold checking implemented in `coverage_analysis.f90`:
  - Lines 98-122: Regular analysis threshold checking
  - Lines 230-251: JSON import threshold checking (implemented but unreachable)
- Exit codes properly defined in `foundation_constants.f90`
- Both `minimum_coverage` and `fail_under_threshold` config fields are supported

## Conclusion
Threshold enforcement is **fully functional** for regular coverage analysis (.gcov files), which is the primary use case for CI/CD integration. The JSON import issue is a separate problem that doesn't affect the core threshold functionality.
