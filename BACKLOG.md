## FUTURE SPRINTS (High-level Planning)

### Sprint 2: Architecture Compliance & Stability
- **Goal**: Achieve full architecture compliance and restore CI stability
- **Approach**: Systematic module decomposition following SRP, infrastructure fixes
- **Key Decisions**: 
  - Priority: CRITICAL infrastructure fixes before architecture refactoring
  - Module extraction strategy: Single responsibility per extracted module
  - Maintain API compatibility during refactoring
- **Success Metrics**: All modules <500 lines, CI fully stable, zero architecture violations

### Sprint 3: Quality & Performance Optimization  
- **Goal**: Enhance test reliability and optimize performance bottlenecks
- **Approach**: Security test stabilization, function-level refactoring for maintainability
- **Key Decisions**:
  - Focus on test infrastructure reliability
  - Function size compliance through focused extraction
  - Performance optimization without sacrificing correctness
