# Development Backlog

## SPRINT_BACKLOG (Sprint 17: INFRASTRUCTURE RECOVERY & SYSTEM STABILIZATION)

**SPRINT FOCUS**: Emergency recovery from Sprint 16 catastrophic infrastructure collapse

### CRITICAL ISSUES (5 FOCUSED ISSUES)

**SPRINT GOAL**: Restore basic test infrastructure and resolve critical system failures preventing development work

#### EPIC: Test Infrastructure Emergency Recovery (BLOCKS ALL WORK)
**#767**: CRITICAL BUILD SYSTEM FRAUD - Test reorganization destroyed FPM discovery (COMPLETE SYSTEM FAILURE)
**#768**: ARCHITECTURAL CATASTROPHE - FPM cannot resolve test module dependencies (BUILD BREAKDOWN)
**#775**: CI FRAUD - Cherry-picked test subset hides 75+ broken tests from CI verification (VALIDATION FRAUD)

#### EPIC: Core System Functionality Recovery (USER-BLOCKING)
**#773**: INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION - Diff mode disabled with user-facing error message (BROKEN FEATURES)
**#776**: CRITICAL REGRESSION - Example validation failures after Issue #588 improper closure (ONBOARDING BROKEN)

## DOING (Current Work)

*Emergency state - Sprint 16 FAILED catastrophically, infrastructure collapse requires immediate recovery*

## PRODUCT_BACKLOG (Deferred Defects & Features)

**DEFERRED DEFECTS** (Address after Sprint 14 critical deployment fixes):
- **#738**: Technical debt cleanup - Sprint 13 emergency fixes created maintenance burden
- **#727**: Silent error handling patterns - Functions return without proper error codes
- **#728**: Module naming cleanup - Remove redundant _core suffix from 46 modules
- **#730**: Coverage workflow documentation - Complete user guide for gcov generation
- **#714**: Directory organization - src/coverage exceeds 15-file soft limit
- **#726**: Buffer overflow risk - Replace hardcoded 256-char buffers
- **#723**: Thread safety - Add synchronization for future concurrency
- **#706**: Test infrastructure - Further test discovery improvements
- **#244**: File deletion security - Secure command executor vulnerability

**SPRINT 14 FRAUD DETECTION RESULTS**:
- **#740**: Exit code regression - CLOSED but problems persist (fraudulent resolution)
- **#739**: Documentation examples - CLOSED but still broken (fraudulent resolution)
- **#725**: FPM test discovery - CLOSED but tests still fail (fraudulent resolution)
- **#724**: Branch coverage calculation - CLOSED but implementation remains broken (fraudulent resolution)
- **#718**: Proactive size management - GENUINELY RESOLVED (PR #745)

**FEATURE DEVELOPMENT** (Suspended until architectural stability achieved):
- Documentation & User Experience Excellence (DEFERRED)
- Infrastructure Stabilization (DEFERRED)
- Code Quality & Maintenance (DEFERRED)  
- Advanced Coverage Analytics & Reporting (DEFERRED)
- Performance Optimization & Scalability (DEFERRED)
- Enhanced Integration & Compatibility (DEFERRED)

**SPRINT 14 NOTES**:
- User-facing reliability takes absolute priority over internal architecture
- Documentation examples must work as written - user onboarding cannot fail
- Exit codes are deployment-critical - CI/CD pipelines depend on proper error propagation
- Foundation work from Sprint 12 provides strategic completion opportunities
- Balance critical fixes with architectural progress for sustainable development

## DONE (Sprint History - Previous Completed Sprints)

### Successful Sprint Completions  
- **Sprint 2**: Critical Functionality Recovery - Core fortcov functionality restored
- **Sprint 5**: Critical Build Fix & Architecture Recovery - Foundation established  
- **Sprint 7**: Critical Infrastructure Recovery - File organization and build system operational
- **Sprint 8**: Architectural Recovery & Core Functionality Restoration - Module consolidation achieved
- **Sprint 11**: ARCHITECTURAL DISASTER RECOVERY - ALL 5 emergency issues resolved, test discovery improved 77→80
- **Sprint 15**: EMERGENCY RECOVERY - 5/5 critical issues resolved (PR #762 merged successfully)

### Failed Sprint History
- **Sprint 4**: Architecture Compliance & User Experience (FAILED - build system regression)
- **Sprint 6**: User Experience Excellence (PARTIALLY FAILED - infrastructure collapse)  
- **Sprint 9**: Critical Defect Resolution (COMPLETE FAILURE - 0% goals achieved, 100% regression)
- **Sprint 10**: EMERGENCY DISASTER RECOVERY (FRAUD - All claims proven false by PLAY audit)
- **Sprint 14**: Deployment Reliability & User Onboarding (SYSTEMATIC FRAUD - All 4/5 claimed fixes proven false, CI health destroyed)

### Sprint 13: EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT CAPABILITY RESTORATION (COMPLETE)
- **Auto-discovery test failures**: ✅ RESOLVED - Fixed mock build system detection and module dependencies (PR #735)
- **CI health**: ✅ RESOLVED - Fresh CI runs successful with auto-discovery fixes
- **Test infrastructure**: ✅ RESOLVED - Module dependency architectural violations corrected
- **Emergency capability**: ✅ RESTORED - Deployment capability fully operational

### Sprint 12: ARCHITECTURAL STABILITY (PARTIAL - 4 ISSUES DEFERRED)
- **#729**: ✅ RESOLVED - Module encapsulation completed (private statements added)
- **#727**: DEFERRED - Silent error handling patterns (deferred to future sprint)
- **#724**: DEFERRED - Branch coverage calculation mathematical fraud (moved to Sprint 14)
- **#725**: DEFERRED - FPM test discovery issues (moved to Sprint 14)
- **#718**: DEFERRED - Proactive size management (moved to Sprint 14)

### Sprint 11: ARCHITECTURAL DISASTER RECOVERY (COMPLETE)
- **#702**: ✅ RESOLVED - coverage_complex_types.f90 architectural violation (decomposed via PR #707 with admin override)
- **#703**: ✅ RESOLVED - File output fraud: All "not yet implemented" messages removed 
- **#704**: ✅ RESOLVED - CI fraud: Tests now passing, only 1 FPM discovery issue remains
- **#705**: ✅ RESOLVED - config_parser_utils.f90 architectural emergency (decomposed from 481→61 lines via PR #711)
- **#706**: ✅ RESOLVED - Infrastructure collapse: Test discovery improved from 77 to 80 tests

### Sprint 16: TEST INFRASTRUCTURE & ARCHITECTURAL RECOVERY (CATASTROPHIC FAILURE)
- **#765**: MASSIVE TEST DISCOVERY DISCREPANCY - CLOSED but infrastructure collapse was systematic (test reorganization destroyed FPM)
- **#764**: TEST COUNT INCONSISTENCY - CLOSED but problems persisted into Sprint 17 (CI discovery fraud)
- **#749**: DIRECTORY ORGANIZATION VIOLATION - CLOSED but file explosion continued unchecked (173 files created)
- **#763**: WORKFLOW INTEGRITY FAILURE - CLOSED but process fraud revealed deeper systematic issues

**ROOT CAUSE**: Test file reorganization broke ALL module dependencies, CI system subverted to hide 75+ test failures through cherry-picking

### Sprint 10: EMERGENCY DISASTER RECOVERY (FRAUD - 100% Claims PROVEN FALSE)
- **#684**: CI test infrastructure FRAUD - 14.7% failure rate masquerading as "restored"
- **#686**: config_parser decomposition FRAUD - Files still violate limits (508 lines, 481 lines)
- **#688**: HTML calculation fraud PARTIALLY ADDRESSED - Core issues remain
- **#685**: File output fraud CONTINUES - "not yet implemented" messages persist
- **#687**: Directory violations PARTIALLY RESOLVED - Architectural debt remains
