# Development Backlog

## SPRINT_BACKLOG (Sprint 12: REPOSITORY COMPLEXITY REDUCTION)

**CRITICAL COMPLEXITY OVERLOAD REQUIRING IMMEDIATE SIMPLIFICATION**

Repository has accumulated catastrophic complexity debt with 544 trash files, obsolete documentation, and directory violations requiring emergency cleanup.

### SPRINT 12 ISSUES (3 ISSUES ONLY - MAXIMUM FOCUS)

- **#713**: CATASTROPHIC TRASH: Remove 544 build artifacts contaminating repository
- **#714**: DIRECTORY VIOLATION: Fix src/coverage exceeding 15-file limit  
- **#715**: CLAUDE.md ARCHITECTURE FRAUD: Replace 206 lines of obsolete lies with 50 lines of truth

**SPRINT GOAL**: Eliminate repository complexity barriers and restore architectural clarity

## DOING (Current Work)

- None (Clean slate for Sprint 12 execution)

## PRODUCT_BACKLOG (Deferred Until Emergency Recovery Complete)

**ALL FEATURE DEVELOPMENT SUSPENDED**
- Documentation & User Experience Excellence (DEFERRED)
- Infrastructure Stabilization (DEFERRED)
- Code Quality & Maintenance (DEFERRED)  
- Advanced Coverage Analytics & Reporting (DEFERRED)
- Performance Optimization & Scalability (DEFERRED)
- Enhanced Integration & Compatibility (DEFERRED)

**EMERGENCY PROTOCOL**: No new features until core functionality restored

## DONE (Sprint History - Previous Completed Sprints)

### Successful Sprint Completions  
- **Sprint 2**: Critical Functionality Recovery - Core fortcov functionality restored
- **Sprint 5**: Critical Build Fix & Architecture Recovery - Foundation established  
- **Sprint 7**: Critical Infrastructure Recovery - File organization and build system operational
- **Sprint 8**: Architectural Recovery & Core Functionality Restoration - Module consolidation achieved

### Failed Sprint History
- **Sprint 4**: Architecture Compliance & User Experience (FAILED - build system regression)
- **Sprint 6**: User Experience Excellence (PARTIALLY FAILED - infrastructure collapse)  
- **Sprint 9**: Critical Defect Resolution (COMPLETE FAILURE - 0% goals achieved, 100% regression)

### Sprint 11: ARCHITECTURAL DISASTER RECOVERY (COMPLETED - FRAUD EXPOSED)
- **#702**: ✅ RESOLVED - coverage_complex_types.f90 architectural violation (decomposed via PR #707 with admin override)
- **#705**: ✅ RESOLVED - config_parser_utils.f90 architectural emergency (decomposed from 481→61 lines via PR #711)
- **REMAINING ISSUES**: #703, #704, #706 transferred to technical debt for future resolution

### Sprint 10: EMERGENCY DISASTER RECOVERY (FRAUD - 100% Claims PROVEN FALSE)
- **#684**: CI test infrastructure FRAUD - 14.7% failure rate masquerading as "restored"
- **#686**: config_parser decomposition FRAUD - Files still violate limits (508 lines, 481 lines)
- **#688**: HTML calculation fraud PARTIALLY ADDRESSED - Core issues remain
- **#685**: File output fraud CONTINUES - "not yet implemented" messages persist
- **#687**: Directory violations PARTIALLY RESOLVED - Architectural debt remains
