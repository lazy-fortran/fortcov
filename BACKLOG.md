# Development Backlog

## SPRINT_BACKLOG (Sprint 11: ARCHITECTURAL DISASTER RECOVERY)

**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL FAILURES EXPOSED BY PLAY AUDIT**

Sprint 10 claims of "100% SUCCESS" are FRAUDULENT. PLAY phase discovered systematic violations and team fraud requiring IMMEDIATE emergency intervention.

### EMERGENCY ISSUES (4 REMAINING - NO EXPANSION)

- **#703**: SYSTEMATIC FRAUD: Fix ALL file output "not yet implemented" failures  
- **#704**: CI FRAUD: Fix 14.7% test failure rate masquerading as success
- **#705**: EMERGENCY: Decompose config_parser_utils.f90 before size violation
- **#706**: INFRASTRUCTURE COLLAPSE: Fix test file chaos and discovery failures

**SPRINT GOAL**: Restore architectural discipline and eliminate systematic fraud

## DOING (Current Work)

**NO ACTIVE WORK** - Ready for next SPRINT_BACKLOG item

## PRODUCT_BACKLOG (Deferred Until Emergency Recovery Complete)

**ALL FEATURE DEVELOPMENT SUSPENDED**
- Documentation & User Experience Excellence (DEFERRED)
- Infrastructure Stabilization (DEFERRED)
- Code Quality & Maintenance (DEFERRED)  
- Advanced Coverage Analytics & Reporting (DEFERRED)
- Performance Optimization & Scalability (DEFERRED)
- Enhanced Integration & Compatibility (DEFERRED)

**EMERGENCY PROTOCOL**: No new features until core functionality restored

## DONE (Sprint History - Previous Completed Sprints)

### Successful Sprint Completions  
- **Sprint 2**: Critical Functionality Recovery - Core fortcov functionality restored
- **Sprint 5**: Critical Build Fix & Architecture Recovery - Foundation established  
- **Sprint 7**: Critical Infrastructure Recovery - File organization and build system operational
- **Sprint 8**: Architectural Recovery & Core Functionality Restoration - Module consolidation achieved

### Failed Sprint History
- **Sprint 4**: Architecture Compliance & User Experience (FAILED - build system regression)
- **Sprint 6**: User Experience Excellence (PARTIALLY FAILED - infrastructure collapse)  
- **Sprint 9**: Critical Defect Resolution (COMPLETE FAILURE - 0% goals achieved, 100% regression)

### Sprint 11: ARCHITECTURAL DISASTER RECOVERY (IN PROGRESS)
- **#702**: âœ… RESOLVED - coverage_complex_types.f90 architectural violation (decomposed via PR #707 with admin override)

### Sprint 10: EMERGENCY DISASTER RECOVERY (FRAUD - 100% Claims PROVEN FALSE)
- **#684**: CI test infrastructure FRAUD - 14.7% failure rate masquerading as "restored"
- **#686**: config_parser decomposition FRAUD - Files still violate limits (508 lines, 481 lines)
- **#688**: HTML calculation fraud PARTIALLY ADDRESSED - Core issues remain
- **#685**: File output fraud CONTINUES - "not yet implemented" messages persist
- **#687**: Directory violations PARTIALLY RESOLVED - Architectural debt remains
