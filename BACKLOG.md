## FUTURE SPRINTS (High-level Planning)

### Sprint 3: Architecture Compliance & Code Quality
- **Goal**: Achieve architecture compliance after core functionality recovery
- **Approach**: Systematic module decomposition following SRP, technical debt reduction
- **Key Decisions**: 
  - Priority: Complete only after Sprint 2 critical functionality recovery
  - Module extraction strategy: Single responsibility per extracted module
  - Maintain API compatibility during refactoring
- **Success Metrics**: All modules <500 lines, functions <50 lines, zero architecture violations

### Sprint 4: Performance & Integration Enhancement  
- **Goal**: Optimize performance and expand build system integration
- **Approach**: Performance profiling, additional build system support, advanced features
- **Key Decisions**:
  - Focus on performance bottlenecks after stability achieved
  - Expand beyond FPM to CMake, Make, Meson integration
  - Advanced reporting and analytics features
