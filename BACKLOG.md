# Development Backlog

## SPRINT_BACKLOG (Sprint 12: ARCHITECTURAL STABILITY & DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING)

**SPRINT FOCUS**: Prevent future violations through proactive architecture management and proper error handling

### CRITICAL ISSUES (MAX 5 - SHORT FOCUSED SPRINT)

**SPRINT GOAL**: Establish architectural stability and defensive programming standards

## DOING (Current Work)

(Empty - Sprint 12 starting)

## PRODUCT_BACKLOG (Deferred Defects & Features)

**DEFERRED DEFECTS** (Address after Sprint 12 critical issues):
- **#728**: Module naming cleanup - Remove redundant _core suffix from 46 modules
- **#730**: Coverage workflow documentation - Complete user guide for gcov generation
- **#714**: Directory organization - src/coverage exceeds 15-file soft limit
- **#726**: Buffer overflow risk - Replace hardcoded 256-char buffers
- **#723**: Thread safety - Add synchronization for future concurrency
- **#706**: Test infrastructure - Further test discovery improvements
- **#244**: File deletion security - Secure command executor vulnerability

**FEATURE DEVELOPMENT** (Suspended until architectural stability achieved):
- Documentation & User Experience Excellence (DEFERRED)
- Infrastructure Stabilization (DEFERRED)
- Code Quality & Maintenance (DEFERRED)  
- Advanced Coverage Analytics & Reporting (DEFERRED)
- Performance Optimization & Scalability (DEFERRED)
- Enhanced Integration & Compatibility (DEFERRED)

**SPRINT 12 NOTES**:
- Proactive architecture management prevents crisis-mode firefighting
- Private-by-default module design improves security and maintainability
- Proper error handling prevents silent failures and debugging nightmares
- Mathematical correctness in calculations prevents user trust erosion

## DONE (Sprint History - Previous Completed Sprints)

### Successful Sprint Completions  
- **Sprint 2**: Critical Functionality Recovery - Core fortcov functionality restored
- **Sprint 5**: Critical Build Fix & Architecture Recovery - Foundation established  
- **Sprint 7**: Critical Infrastructure Recovery - File organization and build system operational
- **Sprint 8**: Architectural Recovery & Core Functionality Restoration - Module consolidation achieved
- **Sprint 11**: ARCHITECTURAL DISASTER RECOVERY - ALL 5 emergency issues resolved, test discovery improved 77→80

### Failed Sprint History
- **Sprint 4**: Architecture Compliance & User Experience (FAILED - build system regression)
- **Sprint 6**: User Experience Excellence (PARTIALLY FAILED - infrastructure collapse)  
- **Sprint 9**: Critical Defect Resolution (COMPLETE FAILURE - 0% goals achieved, 100% regression)

### Sprint 12: ARCHITECTURAL STABILITY (STARTING)
- **#718**: Proactive size management - 9 files at 440-480 lines need decomposition BEFORE violation
- **#729**: Module encapsulation - Add private statement to 114 modules (security/maintainability)
- **#727**: Error handling patterns - Fix silent failures returning without error codes
- **#724**: Branch coverage calculation - Fix 0/0 = 100% mathematical fraud
- **#725**: FPM test discovery - Fix test module imports breaking autodiscovery

### Sprint 11: ARCHITECTURAL DISASTER RECOVERY (COMPLETE)
- **#702**: ✅ RESOLVED - coverage_complex_types.f90 architectural violation (decomposed via PR #707 with admin override)
- **#703**: ✅ RESOLVED - File output fraud: All "not yet implemented" messages removed 
- **#704**: ✅ RESOLVED - CI fraud: Tests now passing, only 1 FPM discovery issue remains
- **#705**: ✅ RESOLVED - config_parser_utils.f90 architectural emergency (decomposed from 481→61 lines via PR #711)
- **#706**: ✅ RESOLVED - Infrastructure collapse: Test discovery improved from 77 to 80 tests

### Sprint 10: EMERGENCY DISASTER RECOVERY (FRAUD - 100% Claims PROVEN FALSE)
- **#684**: CI test infrastructure FRAUD - 14.7% failure rate masquerading as "restored"
- **#686**: config_parser decomposition FRAUD - Files still violate limits (508 lines, 481 lines)
- **#688**: HTML calculation fraud PARTIALLY ADDRESSED - Core issues remain
- **#685**: File output fraud CONTINUES - "not yet implemented" messages persist
- **#687**: Directory violations PARTIALLY RESOLVED - Architectural debt remains
