# Development Backlog

## SPRINT_BACKLOG (Critical Defect Resolution & Architecture Alignment)

### EPIC: Critical Infrastructure Defects
- [ ] #397: README contains multiple non-functional command examples

### EPIC: Core Functionality Restoration
- [ ] CRITICAL: Zero-config fortcov command doesn't work (shows help instead of running coverage) - MUST HAVE for next sprint

### EPIC: Architecture Size Compliance

### EPIC: Code Quality & Dead Code Elimination

## DOING (Current Work)

## PRODUCT_BACKLOG (High-level Features)
- [ ] Advanced Coverage Analytics & Reporting
- [ ] Performance Optimization & Scalability  
- [ ] Enhanced Integration & Compatibility
- [ ] User Experience & Developer Productivity

## DONE (Completed Product Features)  
- [x] Core Functionality Restoration
- [x] Code Quality & Dead Code Elimination

## FUTURE SPRINTS (High-level Planning)

### Sprint 2: Architecture Compliance & Stability
- **Goal**: Achieve full architecture compliance and restore CI stability
- **Approach**: Systematic module decomposition following SRP, infrastructure fixes
- **Key Decisions**: 
  - Priority: CRITICAL infrastructure fixes before architecture refactoring
  - Module extraction strategy: Single responsibility per extracted module
  - Maintain API compatibility during refactoring
- **Success Metrics**: All modules <500 lines, CI fully stable, zero architecture violations

### Sprint 3: Quality & Performance Optimization  
- **Goal**: Enhance test reliability and optimize performance bottlenecks
- **Approach**: Security test stabilization, function-level refactoring for maintainability
- **Key Decisions**:
  - Focus on test infrastructure reliability
  - Function size compliance through focused extraction
  - Performance optimization without sacrificing correctness
