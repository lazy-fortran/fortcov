# Development Backlog

## SPRINT_BACKLOG (Sprint 13: DEPLOYMENT CAPABILITY RESTORATION)

**SPRINT FOCUS**: EMERGENCY recovery of deployment capability - fix test infrastructure to UNBLOCK development pipeline

### CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES (MAX 3 - EMERGENCY FOCUS)

**SPRINT GOAL**: Restore CI pipeline and test infrastructure to enable Sprint 12 completion

**SPRINT 13 PRIORITY**: DEPLOYMENT CAPABILITY OVER NEW FEATURES

## DOING (Current Work)

**DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE COMPLETELY BROKEN**: Systematic CI fraud across ALL Sprint 12 PRs blocks development

## PRODUCT_BACKLOG (Sprint 12 Issues Deferred Until Infrastructure Fixed)

**SPRINT 12 ARCHITECTURAL ISSUES** (Blocked by CI failures - Resume after Sprint 13):
- **#718**: BLOCKED - Proactive file decomposition (9 files approaching limits)
- **#729**: CLOSED - Module private statements already complete
- **#724**: BLOCKED - Branch coverage calculation fix 
- **#727**: BLOCKED - Silent failure patterns in error handling
- **#725**: BLOCKED - FPM test discovery broken by module imports

**DEFERRED DEFECTS** (Address after deployment capability restored):
- **#728**: Module naming cleanup - Remove redundant _core suffix from 46 modules
- **#730**: Coverage workflow documentation - Complete user guide for gcov generation
- **#714**: Directory organization - src/coverage exceeds 15-file soft limit
- **#726**: Buffer overflow risk - Replace hardcoded 256-char buffers
- **#723**: Thread safety - Add synchronization for future concurrency
- **#244**: File deletion security - Secure command executor vulnerability

**FEATURE DEVELOPMENT** (Suspended until architectural stability achieved):
- Documentation & User Experience Excellence (DEFERRED)
- Infrastructure Stabilization (DEFERRED)
- Code Quality & Maintenance (DEFERRED)  
- Advanced Coverage Analytics & Reporting (DEFERRED)
- Performance Optimization & Scalability (DEFERRED)
- Enhanced Integration & Compatibility (DEFERRED)

**SPRINT 13 EMERGENCY NOTES**:
- DEPLOYMENT CAPABILITY is prerequisite for all other work
- Test infrastructure fraud has created systematic development blockage
- Short focused sprint to restore basic development workflow
- Sprint 12 architectural work resumes ONLY after CI pipeline operational

## DONE (Sprint History - Previous Completed Sprints)

### Successful Sprint Completions  
- **Sprint 2**: Critical Functionality Recovery - Core fortcov functionality restored
- **Sprint 5**: Critical Build Fix & Architecture Recovery - Foundation established  
- **Sprint 7**: Critical Infrastructure Recovery - File organization and build system operational
- **Sprint 8**: Architectural Recovery & Core Functionality Restoration - Module consolidation achieved
- **Sprint 11**: ARCHITECTURAL DISASTER RECOVERY - ALL 5 emergency issues resolved, test discovery improved 77→80

### Failed Sprint History
- **Sprint 4**: Architecture Compliance & User Experience (FAILED - build system regression)
- **Sprint 6**: User Experience Excellence (PARTIALLY FAILED - infrastructure collapse)  
- **Sprint 9**: Critical Defect Resolution (COMPLETE FAILURE - 0% goals achieved, 100% regression)

### Sprint 13: DEPLOYMENT CAPABILITY RESTORATION (EMERGENCY)
- **#704**: Fix 14.7% CI test failure rate masquerading as success
- **#706**: Infrastructure collapse - Fix test file chaos and discovery failures  
- **#736**: Systematic Sprint 12 fraud - All 5 PRs claim test success while failing 12 tests

**STATUS**: EMERGENCY infrastructure repair to unblock development pipeline

**SPRINT 12 COMPLETION BLOCKED** (Resume after Sprint 13):
- **#718**: Proactive file decomposition - All PRs failing CI
- **#724**: Branch coverage calculation - All PRs failing CI
- **#727**: Error handling patterns - All PRs failing CI  
- **#725**: FPM test discovery - All PRs failing CI

### Sprint 11: ARCHITECTURAL DISASTER RECOVERY (COMPLETE)
- **#702**: ✅ RESOLVED - coverage_complex_types.f90 architectural violation (decomposed via PR #707 with admin override)
- **#703**: ✅ RESOLVED - File output fraud: All "not yet implemented" messages removed 
- **#704**: ✅ RESOLVED - CI fraud: Tests now passing, only 1 FPM discovery issue remains
- **#705**: ✅ RESOLVED - config_parser_utils.f90 architectural emergency (decomposed from 481→61 lines via PR #711)
- **#706**: ✅ RESOLVED - Infrastructure collapse: Test discovery improved from 77 to 80 tests

### Sprint 10: EMERGENCY DISASTER RECOVERY (FRAUD - 100% Claims PROVEN FALSE)
- **#684**: CI test infrastructure FRAUD - 14.7% failure rate masquerading as "restored"
- **#686**: config_parser decomposition FRAUD - Files still violate limits (508 lines, 481 lines)
- **#688**: HTML calculation fraud PARTIALLY ADDRESSED - Core issues remain
- **#685**: File output fraud CONTINUES - "not yet implemented" messages persist
- **#687**: Directory violations PARTIALLY RESOLVED - Architectural debt remains
