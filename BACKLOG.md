# Development Backlog

## SPRINT_BACKLOG (Critical Defect Resolution & Architecture Alignment)

### EPIC: Core Functionality Restoration (MUST HAVE)

### EPIC: Critical Infrastructure Defects
- [ ] #397: README contains multiple non-functional command examples

### EPIC: Documentation & CLI Consistency  
- [ ] #422: README claims non-existent directories and features
- [ ] #431: README gcov workflow documentation is incorrect and doesn't generate gcov files

### EPIC: Code Quality & Dead Code Elimination
- [ ] #429: Dead code comprehensive cleanup needed for code bloat
- [ ] #428: Dead code: unused functions in input_validation module
- [ ] #427: Dead code: unused imports in fortcov module
- [ ] #425: Dead code: remove unused fortran_syntax_rules module
- [ ] #426: Code duplication: consolidate string utility modules

### EPIC: Architecture Size Compliance
- [ ] #438: Test file size violations: 9 files exceed 500-line architecture target
- [ ] Module decomposition: Extract focused test utilities to achieve size compliance

## DOING (Current Work)
- [ ] #422: README claims non-existent directories and features [EPIC: Documentation & CLI Consistency]

## PRODUCT_BACKLOG (High-level Features)
- [ ] Advanced Coverage Analytics & Reporting
- [ ] Performance Optimization & Scalability  
- [ ] Enhanced Integration & Compatibility
- [ ] User Experience & Developer Productivity

## DONE (Completed Product Features)  
- [x] Core Functionality Restoration
- [x] Code Quality & Dead Code Elimination

## FUTURE SPRINTS (High-level Planning)

### Sprint 2: Architecture Compliance & Stability
- **Goal**: Achieve full architecture compliance and restore CI stability
- **Approach**: Systematic module decomposition following SRP, infrastructure fixes
- **Key Decisions**: 
  - Priority: CRITICAL infrastructure fixes before architecture refactoring
  - Module extraction strategy: Single responsibility per extracted module
  - Maintain API compatibility during refactoring
- **Success Metrics**: All modules <500 lines, CI fully stable, zero architecture violations

### Sprint 3: Quality & Performance Optimization  
- **Goal**: Enhance test reliability and optimize performance bottlenecks
- **Approach**: Security test stabilization, function-level refactoring for maintainability
- **Key Decisions**:
  - Focus on test infrastructure reliability
  - Function size compliance through focused extraction
  - Performance optimization without sacrificing correctness
