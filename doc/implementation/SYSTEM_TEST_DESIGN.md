# System Test Design: Coverage Diff Validation Against pycobertura

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive design for a system-level integration test that validates fortcov's coverage diff functionality against pycobertura as the reference implementation. The test ensures that fortcov produces equivalent diff results to the established tool, providing confidence that our diff algorithm is production-ready and ecosystem-compatible.

## Architecture Overview

### System Test Philosophy

The system test follows a **comparative validation approach** where both tools process identical coverage datasets and produce diff results that are validated for equivalence within defined tolerances. The test architecture emphasizes:

- **Real-world data**: Using actual coverage data from fortcov's own development history
- **Automated execution**: Zero manual intervention required for CI/CD integration  
- **Robust comparison**: Intelligent equivalence checking that accounts for format differences
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Testing multiple scenarios from simple to complex diffs

## Technical Specifications

### 1. Test Data Strategy

#### Commit Pair Selection Algorithm

The test uses **automated commit selection** to identify meaningful baseline/current pairs:

**Selection Criteria**:
- **Temporal spacing**: Commits must be 3-10 commits apart for meaningful differences
- **Code complexity**: Must involve changes to coverage-instrumented source files  
- **Coverage variation**: Baseline and current must have different coverage percentages
- **Build stability**: Both commits must compile and pass basic functionality tests

**Implementation**:
```fortran
type :: commit_pair_t
    character(len=40) :: baseline_sha
    character(len=40) :: current_sha  
    character(len=255) :: baseline_message
    character(len=255) :: current_message
    real :: expected_coverage_delta
end type commit_pair_t
```

#### Pre-validated Commit Pairs

For reliability, the system maintains a curated list of validated commit pairs:

1. **Major Feature Implementation** (e94ccf4 → dfb9d87)
   - Baseline: GCov command execution implementation
   - Current: Complete coverage diff functionality
   - Expected: Significant coverage increase (~15-25%)

2. **Security Fix Implementation** (1816042 → d93a558) 
   - Baseline: Security vulnerability fixes
   - Current: Integration test fixes
   - Expected: Moderate coverage changes (~5-15%)

3. **Parser Enhancement** (4f43cac → c54f247)
   - Baseline: Binary parsing cleanup
   - Current: GCov text parser implementation  
   - Expected: Coverage redistribution across modules

### 2. Data Pipeline Architecture

#### Coverage Data Generation Workflow

```
1. Git Checkout & Build Phase
   ├── git checkout <baseline_sha>
   ├── fpm build --flag "-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage"
   ├── fmp test --flag "-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage" 
   └── fortcov --export-json=baseline.json

2. Coverage Data Collection Phase
   ├── git checkout <current_sha>
   ├── fpm build --flag "-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage"
   ├── fpm test --flag "-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage"
   └── fortcov --export-json=current.json

3. Format Conversion Phase
   ├── json_to_cobertura_xml(baseline.json) → baseline.xml
   ├── json_to_cobertura_xml(current.json) → current.xml
   └── validate_xml_schema(baseline.xml, current.xml)
```

#### Bidirectional Format Conversion

**JSON to Cobertura XML Converter**:
- Maps fortcov JSON schema to Cobertura XML format
- Preserves line execution counts and branch coverage data
- Maintains file path relationships and source line mappings
- Includes proper XML schema validation headers

**Conversion Mapping**:
```
JSON coverage_line_t → XML <line> element
  - execution_count → hits attribute
  - line_number → number attribute  
  - is_executable → branch attribute (if applicable)

JSON coverage_file_t → XML <class> element
  - filename → filename attribute
  - lines array → <lines> children
  - coverage statistics → rate attributes
```

### 3. Comparison Framework

#### Equivalence Validation Engine

The comparison engine implements **intelligent equivalence checking** that accounts for format differences while validating algorithmic correctness:

**Core Validation Components**:

1. **Numerical Tolerance Checking**
   - Coverage percentages: ±0.1% tolerance for floating-point precision
   - Execution counts: Exact matching (integers must be identical)
   - Delta calculations: ±0.01 tolerance for percentage changes

2. **Structural Equivalence Validation**
   - File coverage mappings must be identical (same files processed)
   - Line number sequences must match exactly
   - Branch coverage structure must be preserved

3. **Semantic Diff Comparison**
   - Added coverage lines must match between tools
   - Removed coverage lines must match between tools
   - Changed execution counts must have identical deltas
   - Unchanged lines filtering must produce same results

#### Comparison Algorithm

```fortran
function validate_diff_equivalence(fortcov_result, pycobertura_result) result(is_equivalent)
    type(coverage_diff_t), intent(in) :: fortcov_result
    type(cobertura_diff_t), intent(in) :: pycobertura_result
    logical :: is_equivalent
    
    logical :: files_match, percentages_match, deltas_match, structure_match
    real, parameter :: TOLERANCE = 0.001  ! 0.1% tolerance
    
    ! File-level structure validation
    files_match = validate_file_structure(fortcov_result, pycobertura_result)
    
    ! Coverage percentage comparison with tolerance
    percentages_match = validate_coverage_percentages(fortcov_result, &
                                                     pycobertura_result, TOLERANCE)
    
    ! Delta calculation equivalence  
    deltas_match = validate_delta_calculations(fortcov_result, &
                                              pycobertura_result, TOLERANCE)
    
    ! Diff structure semantic equivalence
    structure_match = validate_diff_structure(fortcov_result, pycobertura_result)
    
    is_equivalent = files_match .and. percentages_match .and. &
                   deltas_match .and. structure_match
end function validate_diff_equivalence
```

### 4. Automation Framework

#### CI/CD Integration Design

**Test Execution Pipeline**:
```yaml
system_diff_validation:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  timeout-minutes: 30
  steps:
    - name: Setup Test Environment

        pip install pycobertura
        fpm build
        
    - name: Execute System Test
      run: |
        ./test_integration/system_diff_validation.sh
        
    - name: Validate Results
      run: |
        python3 ./test_integration/validate_diff_results.py
        
    - name: Archive Test Artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3

        name: diff-validation-results
        path: |
          test_outputs/
          coverage_data/
```

By leveraging fortcov's own development history as test data and implementing intelligent equivalence checking, this system test represents a production-grade validation framework suitable for continuous integration and long-term maintenance.
