===============================

Summary:
  Total checks: 4
  Passed: 3
  Failed: 1
  Success rate: 75.0%

Detailed Results:

   Details:
     file_count: 2

2. [PASS] Mock data comparison - skipping absolute percentage check
   Details:
     note: Mock data uses different percentage formats

3. [FAIL] Coverage deltas differ beyond tolerance
   Details:
     mismatches: [{'file': 'src/coverage_parser.f90', 'fortcov_delta': -0.8, 'pycobertura_delta': -0.5, 'difference': 0.30000000000000004, 'tolerance': 0.01}, {'file': 'src/coverage_model.f90', 'fortcov_delta': 0.5, 'pycobertura_delta': 0.3333, 'difference': 0.16670000000000001, 'tolerance': 0.01}]

4. [PASS] Coverage classifications equivalent (simplified check)
   Details:
     note: Full implementation depends on fortcov diff format
