Generated using Pattern 3: In-Place Build Directory Analysis

## Summary
- **Total Lines**: 45
- **Covered Lines**: 40
- **Coverage Percentage**: 88.9%

## Analysis Details
- **Source Directory**: `build/gfortran_debug/fortcov/`
- **Analysis Method**: Direct build directory analysis
- **Performance**: Fastest method (no file copying)

## Source Files

### build/gfortran_debug/fortcov/demo_calculator.f90
- **Lines**: 35
- **Covered**: 32
- **Coverage**: 91.4%

Functions analyzed in-place:
- `add_numbers`: 100% covered
- `multiply_numbers`: 100% covered
- `divide_numbers`: 85% covered

### build/gfortran_debug/fortcov/main.f90
- **Lines**: 10
- **Covered**: 8
- **Coverage**: 80.0%

## Performance Benefits
- ✓ No file copying overhead
- ✓ Preserves original build structure
- ✓ Faster analysis for large projects
- ✓ Direct analysis of compiler output

## Usage Notes
This pattern is most efficient for automated CI/CD pipelines where
build artifacts don't need to be preserved in the project root.

**Workflow**: fpm test → fortcov --source="build/gfortran_*/fortcov"
