# Investigation Report: Issue #266 - Fix ineffective directory change in test_zero_configuration_issue_249

## Issue Summary
Issue #266 reported ineffective directory change using `execute_command_line("cd " // trim(test_dir))` on lines 43 and 94 in `test/test_zero_configuration_issue_249.f90`.

## Investigation Results

### File System Search
1. **Target file not found**: `test/test_zero_configuration_issue_249.f90` does not exist
2. **Similar file found**: `test/test_issue_249.f90` exists as consolidated test suite for Issue #249
3. **Pattern verification**: No current Fortran test files contain the problematic `execute_command_line("cd "` pattern

### Current State Analysis
- Shell scripts with `cd` usage exist but are disabled (`.FORK_BOMB_DISABLED` extension)
- The existing `test/test_issue_249.f90` does not use `execute_command_line` for directory changes
- Directory operations use proper Fortran intrinsics and safe mechanisms:
  - `safe_mkdir()` for directory creation
  - `rmdir()` with proper validation and escaping
  - File operations with full paths instead of relying on working directory changes

### Historical Context
The issue was reported from PR #261 review, suggesting the problematic pattern may have been:
1. Fixed by using proper Fortran directory handling
2. Removed during code consolidation/cleanup
3. Replaced with safer alternatives in the current implementation

### Code Quality Assessment
Current `test/test_issue_249.f90` shows good practices:
- Uses `safe_mkdir()` with error handling (lines 206-211)
- Creates files with full paths instead of relying on directory changes (line 214)
- Safe directory cleanup with validation (lines 250-298)
- No reliance on shell `cd` commands that don't affect the Fortran process

## Conclusion
Issue #266 appears to be **obsolete**. The reported problematic code pattern does not exist in the current codebase:
- Target file `test/test_zero_configuration_issue_249.f90` not found
- No ineffective `execute_command_line("cd ")` patterns found in any test files
- Existing test infrastructure uses proper Fortran directory handling mechanisms

**Recommendation**: Close issue as resolved/obsolete - the problem has been addressed through proper implementation.
