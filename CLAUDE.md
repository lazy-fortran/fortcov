# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

fortcov is a coverage analysis tool for Fortran code that processes coverage data generated by gfortran with `-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage` flags. The goal is to create an MVP that produces Markdown reports with coverage percentages, similar to lcov and gcovr but specifically tailored for Fortran projects.

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Components

1. **Foundation Layer** ✅
   - `coverage_model.f90`: Complete data model with types for lines, branches, functions, and files
   - `string_utils.f90`: String manipulation utilities 
   - `file_utils.f90`: File system operations

2. **Abstraction Layer** ✅
   - `coverage_parser.f90`: Abstract interface and gcov parser implementation
   - `coverage_reporter.f90`: Abstract reporter interface

3. **Parser Implementation** ✅
   - `gcov_binary_format.f90`: Comprehensive binary parser for .gcno/.gcda files
   - Handles endianness, function metadata, line mappings, and execution counters
   - Includes fallback to gcov text output parsing

4. **Analysis Layer** ✅
   - `coverage_statistics.f90`: Coverage metric calculations
   
5. **Reporter Implementation** ✅
   - `markdown_reporter.f90`: Markdown table generation with coverage percentages

### Work in Progress

- Main application (`app/main.f90`): Currently just a hello world placeholder
- CLI interface: Not yet implemented
- Configuration module: Not yet implemented
- Integration with actual gcov files: Needs real-world testing

## Build and Test Commands

```bash
# Build the project
fpm build

# Build with coverage flags
fpm build --flag "-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage"

# Run tests
fpm test

# Run tests with coverage
fpm test --flag "-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage"

# Clean build artifacts (preserving necessary files)
fpm clean --skip

# Run the main application
fpm run
```

## Architecture and Structure

The project uses the Fortran Package Manager (FPM) structure:

- `src/` - Core library modules for coverage analysis
  - `coverage_model.f90` - Unified data model for coverage information
  - `coverage_parser.f90` - Abstract parser interface and gcov implementation
  - `gcov_binary_format.f90` - Binary format parser for .gcno/.gcda files
  - `coverage_statistics.f90` - Coverage metric calculations
  - `coverage_reporter.f90` - Abstract reporter interface
  - `markdown_reporter.f90` - Markdown report generation
  - `string_utils.f90` - String manipulation utilities
  - `file_utils.f90` - File system operations
  
- `app/` - Main executable entry point
  - `main.f90` - Currently placeholder, needs CLI implementation
  
- `test/` - Test suite with comprehensive coverage
  - Unit tests for all modules
  - Mock implementations for testing abstractions
  - Sample data in `test_data/` and `test_coverage_sample/`

## Coverage Analysis Workflow

1. **Input**: Read .gcda (runtime data) and .gcno (compile-time graph) files generated by gfortran
2. **Processing**: Parse binary coverage data to extract:
   - Line execution counts
   - Branch coverage information
   - Function/subroutine coverage
3. **Analysis**: Calculate coverage metrics:
   - Line coverage percentage
   - Branch coverage percentage
   - File and module-level summaries
4. **Output**: Generate Markdown reports with:
   - Coverage percentages
   - Source code annotation
   - Summary statistics

## Key Implementation Notes

- Coverage data files (.gcda/.gcno) are binary format specific to GCC/gfortran
- The tool should handle both absolute and relative paths in coverage data
- Markdown output should be readable both as plain text and when rendered
- Focus on MVP features: basic line coverage with clear percentage reporting

## Testing Strategy

Tests should verify:
1. Correct parsing of coverage data files
2. Accurate calculation of coverage percentages
3. Proper Markdown formatting in reports
4. Handling of edge cases (no coverage data, 100% coverage, uncovered files)

## Coverage Format Standards

The tool should support intermediate standardized formats for flexibility:
- **Cobertura XML**: Widely supported format, good for CI/CD integration
- **LCOV info format**: Text-based, human-readable format
- Decision on unified internal format to be made based on:
  - Ease of diff generation
  - Tool ecosystem compatibility
  - Multi-compiler support requirements

## Multi-Compiler Support

While initially targeting gfortran, the architecture should accommodate:
- **Intel Fortran Compiler (ifort/ifx)**: Different coverage data format
- **Flang (LLVM-based)**: May use LLVM coverage formats
- Design with abstraction layer for coverage data parsing to enable future compiler support

## Diff Functionality

Future requirement for coverage diff reports:
- Compare coverage between commits/branches
- Show coverage changes (improved/degraded)
- Highlight newly covered/uncovered lines
- Summary statistics of coverage delta

## Development References

Study (but do not copy) the approaches in:
- gcovr: Python-based coverage reporter with extensive features
- lcov: Perl-based coverage tool, standard in many projects
- pycobertura (available in external/): Python library for Cobertura XML manipulation and diff generation

Focus on understanding:
- How they parse various coverage data formats
- Report generation patterns
- Coverage metric calculations
- Diff algorithms for coverage comparison
